Script Name: Logik Backdoor Tool - ping

Usage:

    Part of Logik Backdoor. logik_backdoor.py loads every file in this tools
    folder automatically: the file name is the tool name, the function with that
    same name is the tool, its docstring is the description callers read, and
    TIMEOUT is the number of seconds a caller should wait.

    Keep this file free of side effects at import. Flame also imports every .py
    file in its python folders directly, so anything at module level runs twice.
