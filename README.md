# Logik Portal Python Scripts

This repository is a collection of scripts contributed by members of the Autodesk Flame/Logik community.  We welcome contributions from everyone!

## Installing Python Scripts in Flame

Here’s how to install them:

1. **Using the Logik Portal (Recommended):** Download the scripts directly from this repository using the Logik Portal within Flame. This automatically installs them in the correct location.
2. **Manual Installation (Alternative):**  Copy a script folder to the Flame Python folder (typically `/opt/Autodesk/shared/python`).

`python_scripts.json` is used by the Logik Portal to discover and list these scripts and is not required for any scripts.
